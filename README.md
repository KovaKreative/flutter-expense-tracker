# expense_tracker

This project was built as a part of a Dart + Flutter course. The contents of the project were built from scratch with guidance from lesson work. The main focus of this project was to get comfortable with the Flutter structure and to get accustomed to the flutter development workflow. Once the base project was complete, additional work was done to apply responsiveness to the app, to ensure a functional layout on portrait and landscape screen orientations.
